    "Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. The performance of SVR is influenced by several parameters, including the choice of kernel function, the C parameter, epsilon parameter (ε), and gamma parameter (γ). Let's explore how each parameter works and how they impact SVR's performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The kernel function determines the type of mapping that will be applied to the input data. Common choices include linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid kernels.\n",
    "Effect: The choice of kernel affects the complexity and flexibility of the SVR model. Different kernels may be suitable for different types of data patterns.\n",
    "Example: Use a linear kernel when the relationship between features and target variable is expected to be linear. Use RBF or polynomial kernels for more complex relationships.\n",
    "C Parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The C parameter controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a smooth decision boundary. It balances the desire for a simple model (with a large margin) against the need to correctly classify training points.\n",
    "Effect: Larger C values lead to a smaller-margin hyperplane that classifies all training points correctly but may be sensitive to noise. Smaller C values result in a larger-margin hyperplane, which may tolerate some misclassifications.\n",
    "Example: Increase C when you want a more accurate fit to the training data, but be cautious about overfitting. Decrease C for a smoother model that generalizes better to unseen data.\n",
    "Epsilon Parameter (ε):\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The epsilon-insensitive loss function allows errors up to a certain threshold (ε) without penalty. SVR aims to fit the data within this threshold.\n",
    "Effect: Larger ε values allow for larger deviations from the predicted values without incurring a penalty. Smaller ε values enforce a stricter fit, penalizing deviations more heavily.\n",
    "Example: Increase ε if you want the model to be less sensitive to small errors or noise in the training data. Decrease ε for a more precise fit.\n",
    "Gamma Parameter (γ):\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The gamma parameter defines the influence of a single training example and affects the shape of the decision boundary. It is significant in RBF and polynomial kernels.\n",
    "Effect: Smaller γ values result in a wider Gaussian or polynomial function, leading to a smoother decision boundary. Larger γ values make the model more sensitive to individual data points, potentially leading to a more complex and detailed decision boundary.\n",
    "Example: Increase γ when the data points are expected to have a strong influence only on nearby points in the decision boundary. Decrease γ for a more global influence."

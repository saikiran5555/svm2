    "In Support Vector Regression (SVR), the parameter epsilon (denoted as ε) is part of the epsilon-insensitive loss function, which determines the tube around the predicted values within which no penalty is associated with errors. It essentially defines a margin within which errors are not penalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The epsilon-insensitive loss function is defined as follows for SVR:\n",
    "\n",
    "For errors less than or equal to ε: Loss is 0.\n",
    "For errors greater than ε: Loss increases linearly with the size of the error.\n",
    "Now, let's discuss how increasing the value of epsilon affects the number of support vectors in SVR:\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger Epsilon (\n",
    "�\n",
    "ε):\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the value of epsilon makes the tube wider.\n",
    "A wider tube means that data points can fall within a larger range around the predicted values without incurring a penalty.\n",
    "As a result, fewer data points are treated as support vectors because more data points fall within the wider margin, allowing for a greater tolerance for errors.\n",
    "Smaller Epsilon (\n",
    "�\n",
    "ε):\n",
    "\n",
    "Decreasing the value of epsilon makes the tube narrower.\n",
    "A narrower tube implies that errors outside the tube have a higher impact, and more data points may be treated as support vectors.\n",
    "Smaller epsilon values result in a more strict adherence to the predicted values, leading to a higher number of support vectors."
